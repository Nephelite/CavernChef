23/5:

Added a lot of prefabs

(Found mostly waypoint-based, useful for the tech demo but might not be
for the final product)
- Kevin (4 hours)

24/5:

Made path generation scripts, accounting for future features like
path randomisations. Currently predetermined for the sake of the demo.
- Kevin (3 hours)

25/5:

- Kevin (3 hours)


26/5:
Tried to implement the wisps.
Added some scripts and set up the waypoints and make the wisps follow them.
Currently the wisp does not move and there is an unknown render texture error that
keeps appearing now. Will try to fix tomorrow
- Bryce (2 hrs)


27/5:
Added working Econ TRTs.
- Kevin (1 hour)

Quickly fixed the issue from yesterday with Kevin's help (Prefabs were missing in the Inspector for one of the scripts).

- Kevin (4 hours, started from 27/5)

Implemented a basic Main Menu and a Food Selection scene before the Tower Defense mode.
Textures to be replaced eventually, further down the line.

-Kevin (1 hour)

31/5:
Created an algorithm that can easily generate an SSSP algorithm from our current needs.
Plannedd to be evolved into a psuedd-random path generator.
-Kevin (3 hours)

1/6 - 2/6:
Created the randomised path generation algorithm.
Bugs created: 
1. Creates dead ends
2. Intersecting paths are possible, esp with longer path generations
Possibly problematic if there are more than 1 spawn point, but not a concern for now
- Kevin (6 hours collectively across 1st and 2nd June)

2/6 - 4/6:
Created `EnemyList` class as a custom priority queue for tracking enemies in each wave to eventually replace the current array.
Created abstract class `Enemy` to eventually superclass Wispy.
- Bryce (5.5 hrs total, June 2 0.5 hrs + June 3 1.5 hrs + June 4 3.5 hrs)

4/6 - 5/6:
Created a fully functional enemy pathfinding script using A*.
Note: The code is a commented code block meant to be copied into objects using the algorithm.
- Kevin (12 hours collectively across 4th and 5th June)

5/6 - 7/6:
Replaced array in the internal representation of enemies in `EnemyList` class with a List.
Replaced the array in GlobalVariables.enemyList with the custom class `EnemyList`.
Completed and incorporated abstract `Enemy` class into current version.
Updated script for `TRTLookAtEnemy` to only look at enemies when they are in range
Updated movement of Wispies to follow the path generated by Kevin's code.
Somehow(???) cleared bugs from the new implementation, I hope.
- Bryce (6 hrs total, June 5 1.5 hrs + June 6 2.5 hrs + June 7 2 hrs)

9/6 - 12/6 morning:
Ideation for possible types of turrets.
Implementation of EnemyStatus class within Enemy.cs to handle interactions of turret abilities. To be incorporated.
Moved some fields from BasicOffenseTRT to the general TRT class to better follow OOP principles.
Renaming basic TRT to Fire Turret and other similar renamings.
- Bryce (4.5 hrs total, June 9 0.5 hrs + June 10 1 hr + June 11 2.5 hrs + June 12 0.5 hrs)

Wisps now all properly animate for moving and dying
Death animations also don't impact the priority system for targeting.
- Kevin (3 hrs)

Implemented the scripts for other turrets (except light), though they cannot be used until the projectiles are also implemented.
Slightly modified the logic of the code of FireTRT.cs to be shorter and neater.
Cleaned out some of my messy comments.
Added the sprites made by Kevin and cut them up with instructions from Kevin.
- Bryce (4.5 hrs total, June 14 1.5 hrs + June 15 3 hrs)

15/6: 
Created the prefabs using the assets made
- Kevin (1 hr)

Next TODO: Add AoE and Lightning chaining to EnemyList and incorporate them into relevant projectiles.
- Bryce (2 hrs total, June 15 1 hr + June 16 1 hr)

16/6 - 17/6:

TODO2: Implement LightTRT
- Bryce (3 hrs total, June 17 0.5 hrs + June 18 1 hr + June 19 1.5 hrs)

20/6: 
Implemented a blockage TRT.
Desc: When placed on an enemy path tile, all spawners and enemies will search for a path without the tile with the blockage.
Currently implemented: Almost everything about it
Not implemented: A check for if a valid path exists if the initial path is blocked off.
Bug: Priority is messed up. Awaiting Bryce's bugfix as he is the one to implement the priority system.
Slight bug: Occasionally, enemies will stall slightly on a tile when blockage is placed.
This is likely to be because of how we coded wisps to move. To be fixed later as bug is super minor.
- Kevin (5 hrs)

21/6:
Implemented a stalling TRT.
Currently enemies do damage per frame so the stalling TRT has inflated HP.
To revisit and balance once enemies have an attack cycle.
Bug fixing
- Kevin (3hrs)

Updated priority of Enemies to be able to handle blockage placements (renamed to distToFood also for practicality).
Updated EnemyList to use this new definition of priority.
Updated the movement of enemies to use this new variable distToFood.
Added layers of abstraction to Enemy through methods.
Bug: Placing a blockage causes the error "NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object" and kills all the enemies on the board atm.
Bug fixing (including above bug)
- Bryce (3.25 hrs)

22/6: 
Implemented multiple enemy spawns system, and changed the path generation and spawner
